When tranferring refrigerant into cylinders, ensure that only appropriate refrigerant 
recovery cylinders are employed. Ensure that the correct numbers of cylinders for holding 
the total system charge are available. All cylinders to be used are designated for the 
recovered refrigerant and labelled for that refrigerant(i.e special cylinders for the 
recovery of refrigerant). Cylinders shall be complete with pressure relief valve and 
associated shut-off valves in good working order.
