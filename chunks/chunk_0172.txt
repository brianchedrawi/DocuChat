 CAUTION
• 
If the indoor unit is installed higher than the 
outdoor unit:  
 
An oil trap should be installed every 10m
(32.8ft) of vertical suction line riser.
-If oil ﬂows back into the outdoor unit’s 
 compressor, this might cause liquid 
 compression or deterioration of oil return. 
 Oil traps in the rising gas piping can prevent 
 this.
