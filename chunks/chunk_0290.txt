the vacuum in the system with OFN and continuing to fill until the working pressure is achieved, 
then venting to atmosphere, and finally pulling down to a vacuum. This process shall be repeated 
until no refrigerant is within the system. When the final OFN charge is used, the system shall be 
vented down to atmospheric pressure to enable work to take place. This operation is absolutely 
vital if brazing operations on the pipe-work are to take place.
