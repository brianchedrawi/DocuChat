A device is used to raise the hose discharge at least 1 m above ground level and so that the 
  discharge is pointed in an upwards direction (to assist with dilution)
  The end of the hose can now discharge and disperse the flammable fumes into the ambient air. 
  There should not be any restriction or sharp bends within the vent-line which will hinder the 
  ease of flow. 
  There must be no sources of ignition near the hose discharge
