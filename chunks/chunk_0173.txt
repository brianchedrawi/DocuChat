Air Evacuation
 
Preparations and Precautions
Air and foreign matter in the refrigerant circuit can 
cause abnormal rises in pressure, which can damage 
the air conditioner, reduce its efﬁciency, and cause
injury. Use a vacuum pump and manifold gauge to 
evacuate the refrigerant circuit, removing any 
non-condensable gas and moisture from the system.      
Evacuation should be performed upon initial 
installation and when unit is relocated.
