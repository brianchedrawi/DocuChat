Air Filter Replacement Reminder
After 2,880 hours of use, the display window on 
the indoor unit will flash “nF.” This is a reminder 
to replace your filter. After 15 seconds, the unit 
will revert to its previous display.
To reset the reminder, press the LED button 
on your remote control 4 times, or press the
MANUAL CONTROL button 3 times. If you don’t  
reset the reminder, the “nF” indicator will flash 
again when you restart the unit.
