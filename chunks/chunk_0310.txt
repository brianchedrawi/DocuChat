4.  Storage of equipment/appliances
     The storage of equipment should be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Storage of packed (unsold) equipment
    Storage package protection should be constructed such that mechanical damage to the 
    equipment inside the package will not cause a leak of the refrigerant charge.
    The maximum number of pieces of equipment permitted to be stored together will be 
    determined by local regulations.
