by applying slight pressure to the left and the 
right-hand sides of the unit.
If refrigerant piping is already embedded in 
the wall, do the following:
1. Hook the top of the indoor unit on the upper 
hook of the mounting plate.
2. Use a bracket or wedge to prop up the unit, 
giving you enough room to connect the 
refrigerant piping, signal cable, and drain 
hose. 
3. Connect drain hose and refrigerant piping 
(refer to Refrigerant Piping Connection  
section of this manual for instructions).
