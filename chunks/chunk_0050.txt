 (32°F ), we strongly  
recommend keeping the
unit plugged in at all 
time to ensure smooth
ongoing performance. 
NOTE: Room relative humidity less than 80%. If the air conditioner operates in excess of this 
figure, the surface of the air conditioner may attract condensation. Please sets the vertical air 
flow louver to its maximum angle (vertically to the floor), and set HIGH fan mode.
