The FOLLOW ME function enables the remote
control to measure the temperature at its
current location and send this signal to the
air conditioner every 3 minutes interval. 
When using AUTO, COOL or HEAT modes,
measuring ambient temperature from the
remote control(instead of from the indoor 
unit itself) will enable the air conditioner to
optimize the temperature around you and
ensure maximum comfort.
