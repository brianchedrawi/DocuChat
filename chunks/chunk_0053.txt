The SLEEP function is used to decrease
energy use while you sleep (and don’t 
need the same temperature settings to 
stay comfortable). This function can only
be activated via remote control. And the
Sleep function is not available in FAN or
DRY mode. 
Press the SLEEP button when you are
ready to go to sleep. When in COOL mode, 
the unit will increase the temperature 
by 1°C (2°F) after 1 hour, and will increase 
an additional 1°C (2°F) after another hour.
