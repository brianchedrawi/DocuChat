Press CLEAN button
The Active Clean Technology washes away dust, mold, and grease that may cause 
odors when it adheres to the heat exchanger by automatically freezing and then rapidly 
thawing the frost.
When this function is turned on, the indoor unit display window appears “CL”, after
20 to 45 minutes, the unit will turn off automatically and cancel CLEAN function.
