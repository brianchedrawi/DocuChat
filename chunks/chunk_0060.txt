NOTE ON LOUVER ANGLES 
When using COOL or DRY mode, do not set 
louver at too vertical an angle for long periods 
of time. This can cause water to condense on 
the louver blade, which will drop on your ﬂoor 
or furnishings. 
When using COOL or HEAT mode, setting the 
louver at too vertical an angle can reduce the 
performance of the unit due to restricted air 
ﬂow.
