When connecting refrigerant piping, do not  let substances or gases other than the specified 
refrigerant enter the unit. The presence of other gases or substances will lower the unit’s capacity, 
and can cause abnormally high pressure in the refrigeration cycle. This can cause explosion and
injury. 
2. Using a pipe cutter, cut the pipe a little longer 
than the measured distance.
3. Make sure that the pipe is cut at a perfect 90° 
angle.
