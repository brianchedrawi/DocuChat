-It is recommended that vertical suction risers 
not be upsized. Proper oil return to the 
compressor should be maintained with suction 
gas velocity. If velocities drop below7.62m/s
(1500fpm (feet per minute)), oil return will be
decreased. An oil trap should be installed every 
6m(20ft) of vertical suction line riser.
