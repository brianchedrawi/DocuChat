11. Repair to intrinsically safe components
Do not apply any permanent inductive or capacitance loads to the circuit without ensuring
that this will not exceed the permissible voltage and current permitted for the equipment in
use. Intrinscially safe components are the only types that can be worked on while live in the
presence of a flammable atmosphere. The test apparatus shall be at the correct rating.
